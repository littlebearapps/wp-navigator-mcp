name: Publish to npm

# This workflow can be triggered:
# 1. Automatically via release-please.yml after a release is created (primary method)
# 2. Manually via workflow_dispatch for re-runs or recovery
# 3. On release published event (backup, may require manual draft toggle due to GITHUB_TOKEN limitations)
#
# NOTE: This workflow only runs in the PUBLIC repo (littlebearapps/wp-navigator-mcp).
# The master repo (private) should not publish - provenance requires public repos.
